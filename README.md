Hypothesis testing of Zipf's Law for natural and unnatural languages (NLP SP19)

_**Introduction**_

This project will test Zipf's Law on large samples of natural language as well
as samples of randomly-generated text, used to simulate non-natural language.

Zipf's Law is a phenomenon seemingly characteristic of nearly all natural
languages that defines an inverse relationship between word frequency and rank. 
That is, in any given text, the 30th most commonly-used word will appear
three more times than the 90th most commonly-used word.

This relationship can be represented by the equation ``c*r=k`` where ``c`` is
a word's count (i.e. how many times the word appears in the text), ``r`` is the
word's rank (1st highest word count, 2nd highest, etc.) and ``k`` is some constant
of proportionality (which should the same within the same text).
